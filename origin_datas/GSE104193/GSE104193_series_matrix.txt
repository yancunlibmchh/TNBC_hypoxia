One microgram of total protein from the supernatant was loaded onto a 10%â€?0% sucrose gradient, made with the BioComp Gradient Maker, and ultracentrifuged at 37,000 rpm (SW40 rotor) for 150 minutes at 4Â°C. The sucrose gradient was fractionated with the ISCP UV gradient fractionation system (BioComp), connected to a UV detector to monitor absorbance at 254 nm, and the polysome profile was recorded. Twelve fractions of 900 Î¼l each were isolated and RNA was extracted using phenol:chloroform and ethanol precipitation followed by an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) for DNase treatment according to the manufacturer's instructions.
